<h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<P><a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">Lorem Ipsum</a>
is simply dummy text of
the <strong>printing <u>and</u> typesetting</strong> industry.
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted
by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using<br><br>
<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:20px;">'Content here, content here', making it look like readable
English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page
editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
(injected humour and the like).</p>
